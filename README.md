# Grade: Chrome Extension

This is the Chrome extension. To compile an extension from source, run

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```

You can then find the compiled plugin at `dist/grade.zip`. To install it, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
using a Chromium-based browser, toggle on the developer mode at top-right corner, and drag-and-drop the zip file 
into the page.
